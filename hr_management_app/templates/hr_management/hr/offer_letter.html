                                        Solutions Limited expects to invest considerable time, effort and capital in
                                        enhancing the value and desirability of my skills. Both this investment and
                                        my compensation reflect Olatech Solutions Limited's expectation of receiving
                                        a considerable return from the exclusive use of my services and know-how in

                                        or competitors may attempt to cause me to leave Olatech Solutions Limited
                                        and wrongfully gain the benefit of Olatech Solutions Limited's investment.
